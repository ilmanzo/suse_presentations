## Why it's useful ?

- *"Best Data Structure and Algorithms Book for Beginners"*
- explains in a simple and visual way, easy to understand language
- many such interesting and real-world examples
- short to read, chapters are bite-sized and self-contained
- even if you won't learn much new, you still could learn how to explain some of the more abstractish concepts in a very visual, simple and entertaining way.
