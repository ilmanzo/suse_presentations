# Why ? I like my old tools!

## ... and they work flawlessly ðŸ˜ 

- A pillar of free software: diversity, richness, freedom of choice... The [Bazaar](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/)! 
- New users use them on other platforms, maybe you want to know what those foolish young hipsters mess around with ðŸ¤“
- Totally optional, use at your own pace. Nothing disappears installing them
- Good OSS projects, small enough to start contributing in a new programming language (also because they may lack features that unix veterans can bring in ðŸ˜‰) 
- Why not ? Trying something new won't hurt

# And of course...

##  ... because there's a cute mascot like Ferris the crab
