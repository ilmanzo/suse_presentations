# Why ? I like my old tools!

- New users use them on other platforms, maybe you want to know what's around
- Totally optional, use at your own pace. Nothing disappears installing them
- Good OSS projects, small enough to start contributing in a new programming language (also because they may lack features that unix veterans can bring in ðŸ˜‰) 
- Why not ? Trying something new doesn't hurt

# And of course...

##  ... because there's a cute mascot
